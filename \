\subsection{Generating the User Profile}
Social media's effect on the world is something significant~\cite{Miller2016}.
That is why the application builds a user profile from
the user's social media. 

The application built by Lim et al.~\cite{Lim2018a} allowed the user to connect
the application with their Flickr profile to scan their past trips. However,
Facebook provides an API that would allow users to connect both their Facebook
and Instagram accounts and request content from the user with their permission.
A significant advantage is that the API allows the application not to limit the
application with the user's trips. The app requests two things from the
potential tourist's social media, the photos and the liked pages and tries to
classify these into six categories that make up the user's travel interest
vector; 

[   
1 Beach
2 Nature
3 Shopping
4 Museums
5 Clubbing
6 Bars]


These categories are the same categories that we requested from the google maps
API except `cafeterias' and `restaurants'. These two categories were not
included because the application tries to suggest the best places to eat as
part of the timetable, irrelevant to the user's profile. At the start of the
application, the app initialises all vector values to zero and increments a
value whenever the user's content matches a category. We will describe how the
app classifies both the user's liked pages and the user's photos separately in
the upcoming subsections.
