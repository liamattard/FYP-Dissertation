\subsection{Producing the activity plan}

After the app generates the dataset of POIs and the
user's travel interest vector, we formulate an
efficient activity plan using these two inputs. This
itinerary generator is based on the existing state of
the art activity planners~\cite{Sylejmani2017, Wisittipanich2020}
with some adjustments: We wanted the trip's output to take the
form of an itinerary.  The problem takes the form of
the `day' and `night'  category split discussed in
the literature review.  The scoring of itineraries is adjusted
with the travel interest vector.

The problem definition of our novel itinerary planner
is mathematically formulated as follows. A tourist trip is made up
of some pre-defined user constants alongside the travel interest
vector. The predefined constants are:

\subsubsection{Optimisation Algorithms}

The following will discuss the steps required to
produce the two timetable optimisation algorithms. PSO
and GAs are two meta-heuristics that use a population
to converge to a fit solution. Therefore, they require
an initial random generation of possible timetables. In
our algorithm, we introduce a method of randomisation
bias which will be discussed before the algorithms.


\paragraph{Random Bias}
With this technique, the randomness of the initial
population is weighted based on two components.
\begin{enumerate}

    \item  the place's rating and 

    \item the place's number of ratings.
\end{enumerate}


Before the algorithm starts each POI will be given a score 
that will determine its probability of being chosen as
part of the initial population. For example, if a
POI $i$ has a rating, 
$r_i$ which a value from 0 to 5, and
the number of ratings from users $z_i$. The score of $i$
is calculated using the following equation:

    \begin{center}
        score = $\frac{r_i}{5}+\frac{z_i}{\text{max}(\sum_{j=0}^{N}{z_j})}$

    \end{center}
%\[ \text{score} = (p_i)p_i\text{.rating}\]

This bias gives a head start to the algorithm
rather than just starting optimising from purely
random itineraries, highly likely to be of bad
quality.

\paragraph{Particle Swarm Optimisation}

In PSO, the whole population is referred to as the
swarm, whilst a single member a particle. Each
particle has a 2-dimensional position(P) vector
representing the current timetable solution and a
2-dimensional velocity(V) vector expressing the direction
of the particle during its search period. 

The algorithm has four integer parameters. The
personal acceleration (PA) affects how far away the
particle moves from the personal best position (PB). 
The global best acceleration (GA) attracts the global
best position (GB) of the whole swarm. 
The inertia (I) constant helps the particle
explore new solutions and escape the local minima
through randomness. 

At each
iteration, the new velocity is calculated using
\begin{center}
    new velocity = I + (PA * (PB - P)) + (GA * (GB - P))
\end{center}

the new position is calculated using
\begin{center}
    new position = P + new velocity 
\end{center}

After a few iterations have passed, particles use
their velocity and move towards the optimum position.
We demonstrate the framework of our PSO algorithm in
algorithm \ref{PSOAlgorithm}.

             %%maxScore = particles[i].score

\paragraph{Genetic Algorithms}

Genetics algorithms use biological terms to describe
their attributes. For example, in this algorithm, a
timetable solution in population is referred to as a
chromosome. (cite)

The first step is to generate a random population, and
we use the same random bias. In PSO, the algorithm
optimises by allowing each particle to move closer to
the global best every iteration. In comparison, in
GAs, first, the best chromosomes known as the elites
are selected from each iteration. Then, three
techniques, namely selection, mutation, and crossover,
are applied to generate the next population. We show
the framework of this algorithm in figure X. 


\subsection{Web application implementation and user
interface}

We built the application using several technologies
where each communicates with each other to provide a
user-friendly website for the potential tourist.
Figure~\ref{TechStack} shows the tech stack diagram of the website.
The website is accessible through the URL
\url{https://www.touristplanner.xyz}. We built the front end of the website using HTML, CSS and javascript and hosted it
on a cloud Vultr server. The website is 
responsive to be accessible from both a
mobile phone and a laptop. The website communicates
with the back end of the application using REST
endpoints, hosted on a separate dedicated server
provided by Hetzner using the Java Spring Boot
framework.  Another Python Gunicorn server is used to
generate the itinerary and calculate a travel interest
vector which sends the information directly to the
Spring boot server. Finally, a local instance of an
Open Source Routing Machine server calculates the
distances from one tourist attraction to another used
by the Gunicorn server to optimise the itinerary.

Figure~\ref{Timeline} shows screenshots of the website portraying
the user's timeline.  The user navigates to the
homepage, accepts terms and conditions and connect his
social media profiles.  The user selects the number of
days M and the activity moderation C.  The website
navigates to the final page of the application
exhibiting their personalised itinerary.
