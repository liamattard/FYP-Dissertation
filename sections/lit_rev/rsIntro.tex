\subsection{Recommender Systems} 

We introduce the term Recommender Systems (RS) as a solution for the TTDP and
present background knowledge and relevant work that forms this thesis's basis.
RSs hold use cases in diverse fields, such as e-commerce, media, and
tourism~\cite{Herzog2020}. However, in tourism, RSs offer tourists information
in a unified and centralised manner, providing them with a plan for their trip
~\cite{Santamaria-Granados2020, DiBitonto2010a, Lim2018}.  Two domains develop
current RSs for the TTDP solutions, which are; methods for obtaining tourist
products (such as events and Point of Interests (POI)) and tour recommendation
algorithms that create tourist trips~\cite{Lim2018} as shown in Figure \ref{RS}.  The following sections
discuss related work in each field and discuss adding personalisation to RSs.
